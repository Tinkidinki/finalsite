## Introduction
- Language for dealing with quantum circuits
- Own axioms, use these axioms to do rewrites
- Translation from linear maps to these guys and back

Show example
- of the circuit
- of the commutation thing


- Why is this more useful than just circuits?
- Break up unitaries into components
- Apply rewrites on those components
- Get them back to unitaries

Idea: we may have better rewrites, or we can optimise circuits better, if we are allowed to "look into each component"
So, there are these gadgets that make up stuff

Why I'm interested
- Diagrammatic reasoning helped in my own research quite a lot
- Optimization, surface codes, quantum nlp
- Other proofs of correctness for quantum theorems


1. Spiders

What a general spider is, colors
- Identity, Z gate, X gate, T gate
- The states
- Scalars: no inputs and outputs
- Identity equation

2. Hadamard
3. Swap
4. Cups and caps
5. Yanking equation
6. Adjoint, transpose, conjugate
- spider symmetries with transpose
7. Why do we not have the Y spiders

[Matrix equivalent?]

8. Axioms
- spider fusion
- pi-copy rule
- state-copy rule
- Hadamard colour change rules


Examples
- GHZ state preparation
- Pauli pushing
- Magic state injection
- Teleportation



Questions that we ask:
- universal
- sound
- complete
