- QSP and qubitization
Qubitization is the process of taking some unitary, and caring about only what the unitary does to a 2-dimensional subspace. The unitary may preserve the subspace, or take this subspace to another two-dimensional subspace. The idea is: the action of the unitary on a 2-dimensional subspace (or qubit) can be visualized as a rotation on the Bloch sphere. Hence the term "qubitization". 

We have already used this in the last post: while the quantum singular value transform is a protocol defined on unitaries acting only on a qubit, we applied the same rules to arbitrary unitaries by "qubitizing" them. The QSVT takes this one step further: it is the recognition that a unitary can be multiply-qubitized: you can care about what it does to separate 2-dimensional subspaces.
- QSVT from qubitization
- Giving phase to a subspace
- Grover's search and QSVT
- Controlled unitaries for Grover's and getting the subspace phases
- Finally done!
